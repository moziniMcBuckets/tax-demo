# Development Best Practices

This repository comes equipped with a `Makefile`. Running `make all` will run linting and unit tests. In order for code to be successfully pushed through the built-in CI/CD pipeline, it will have to pass these tests. So, be sure to run linting, formatting, etc periodically to make sure the code is properly formatted and is free of linting errors.

Remember: Always prioritize code quality, security, and maintainability in your development practices.
