## Email Templates

### Outreach Email Template

**Subject:** Never miss another $2,000 job

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company Name] on Google Maps and wanted to reach out.

I'm building Vela - AI squads for home service businesses like yours.

Here's the problem we solve:
- You're on a job site
- A lead calls or emails
- By the time you respond, they've hired someone else

Our Operations Squad responds in 60 seconds, qualifies the lead, and books the appointment—while you're still on the ladder.

Our beta customers are closing 3x more leads.

Would you be open to a 15-minute demo?

[Your Name]
Founder, Vela
[Calendly link]
```

---

### LinkedIn Message Template

```
Hi [Name],

I see you run [Company Name] - impressive work!

I'm building Vela, an AI platform for home service businesses.

We help companies like yours capture more leads (respond in 60 seconds) and book more appointments automatically.

Would you be open to a quick demo? It's pretty cool.

[Your Name]
vela.ai
```

## Demo Script

"Thanks for taking the time. I'm [Name], building Vela. We help home service businesses like yours capture more leads and book more appointments automatically. Sound interesting?"

**Problem (2 min):**
"Let me guess - you're on a job site, a lead comes in, and by the time you call back, they've hired someone else. How often does this happen?"

[Let them talk - this is the pain]

**Solution (3 min):**
"Here's what we built. [Show demo video]
- Lead comes in via email or SMS
- Our AI responds in 60 seconds
- Qualifies the lead
- Books the appointment
- All automatic, 24/7"

**ROI (2 min):**
"If we help you close just ONE extra $2,000 job per month, we've paid for ourselves 5x over. And our beta customers are closing 3x more leads."

**Pricing (1 min):**
"It's $499/month. No setup fee. 14-day free trial. Cancel anytime."

**Close (1 min):**
